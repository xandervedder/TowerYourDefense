# List dependencies and install them. This is file is a simpler way
# of doing that.

# Installation directory containing all the modules this project uses.

# Before installing, we should clear the tree (if it exists).
luarocks purge --tree $DIR_NAME

# Install dependencies locally, so LÃ–VE understands them.

# wants the helper commands to go (`bashrc`, or `zshrc`).
