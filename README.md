# Tower Your Defense

This is an attempt at creating a fun and innovative [Tower Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense) game.

Most Tower Defense games get rather repetitive and only restrict towers to a few predefined types that each have their own purpose, like shooting at flying enemies.

This game takes a different approach to towers. Its system is similar to [GemCraft](https://store.steampowered.com/app/296490/GemCraft__Chasing_Shadows/), though more expanded upon the concept (in contrast to the original GemCraft). In the case of this game, it will be possible to alter the tower to your preference (enemy group, damage output, and more...).

Another big difference with all the other Tower Defense games, is that you will have to collect resources to make said towers, similar to an RTS. You will also be able to walk around and enter different vehicles (made with resources).
